A Multi-Stage Machine Learning Model for Security Analysis in Industrial Control System
The feature extraction and selection were carried out on the initial dataset during the pre-processing period. In the second phase, our machine learning models were analyzed based on train and test datasets. In our experiment, we tested the efficiency of the supervised machine learning algorithm in cyber-attack detection with a multi-layer perceptron algorithm.
